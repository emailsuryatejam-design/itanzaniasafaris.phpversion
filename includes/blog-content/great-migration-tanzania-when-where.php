<p>The Great Migration is widely regarded as the greatest wildlife spectacle on Earth. Every year, over 1.5 million wildebeest, accompanied by 400,000 zebra and 200,000 gazelle, undertake a circular journey across the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem in search of fresh grazing and water. This guide tells you exactly when and where to position yourself to witness the most dramatic moments of this extraordinary natural event.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Great Migration Cycle</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, the Great Migration is not a single event or a simple point-A-to-point-B journey. It is a continuous, year-round circular movement covering approximately 800 kilometers through the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and the Masai Mara in Kenya. The herds follow the rains, moving toward areas of new grass growth.</p>
<p>The migration is broadly predictable based on historical rainfall patterns, but exact timing varies year to year. Working with a <a href="about.php">local operator based in Tanzania</a> who has real-time intelligence on herd locations is crucial for planning your trip around the migration.</p>

<h2>December to March: Calving Season in the Southern Serengeti</h2>
<p>As the short rains green up the nutrient-rich volcanic soils of the southern Serengeti and Ndutu plains, the massive herds concentrate here for calving season. This is one of the migration's most spectacular — and underrated — periods.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Approximately 500,000 calves are born during a concentrated 2-3 week period, typically in February</li>
  <li>The open, flat plains offer unobstructed views of herds stretching to the horizon</li>
  <li>Predators (lions, cheetahs, hyenas, wild dogs) converge for the feast, creating non-stop predator-prey action</li>
  <li>Calves can stand and run within minutes of birth — an incredible survival adaptation</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ndutu area, straddling the border of the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Conservation Area, is the prime location. Some of our best wildlife photography has come from calving season safaris.</p>

<h2>April to May: Moving Through Central Serengeti</h2>
<p>As the long rains arrive, the southern plains become waterlogged and the grass is consumed. The herds begin their northwestward march through the central Serengeti. This is the quietest period for tourism, with many camps closed and roads potentially challenging.</p>
<p>However, for adventurous travelers, the green season offers dramatic storm-lit skies, lush landscapes, and virtually private game viewing at significantly lower prices.</p>

<h2>June to July: Grumeti River Crossings</h2>
<p>The herds reach the Western Corridor and face their first major obstacle: the Grumeti River. Though smaller than the Mara River, the Grumeti is home to some of the largest Nile crocodiles in the Serengeti, some exceeding 5 meters in length.</p>
<p><strong>What to expect:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Herds build up on the riverbanks, sometimes for days, before a critical mass triggers a crossing</li>
  <li>Crossings can be explosive — thousands of animals plunging in simultaneously</li>
  <li>Crocodile attacks, drownings, and stampedes create raw, intense drama</li>
  <li>Fewer safari vehicles compared to the Mara River crossings later in the season</li>
</ul>
<p>The Grumeti concessions offer some of the most exclusive and uncrowded migration viewing in the entire ecosystem.</p>

<h2>August to October: Mara River Crossings — The Main Event</h2>
<p>This is the period most people associate with the Great Migration. The herds reach the northern Serengeti (Kogatende area) and must cross the Mara River — a formidable barrier of fast-flowing water, steep banks, and massive crocodiles.</p>
<p><strong>Why the Mara crossings are so dramatic:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The river is wider, deeper, and more dangerous than the Grumeti</li>
  <li>Herds may attempt multiple crossings per day at different points along the river</li>
  <li>Some crossings involve 50,000+ animals in a single event lasting hours</li>
  <li>Crocodiles up to 6 meters long lie in wait; lions and leopards patrol the banks</li>
  <li>Failed crossings — where herds turn back mid-river — are as dramatic as successful ones</li>
</ul>
<p>The northern Serengeti is more remote and requires more travel time from Arusha, but the reward is witnessing arguably the single most dramatic wildlife event on Earth.</p>

<h2>November: The Return South</h2>
<p>As the short rains begin in November, the herds respond to the greening of the southern plains and begin their long journey south. The eastern Serengeti sees large movements during this transitional period. By December, the cycle begins anew as the herds settle into the Ndutu and southern Serengeti plains.</p>

<h2>Where to Stay for the Best Migration Viewing</h2>
<p>Positioning is everything for migration safaris. Here are the key areas by season:</p>
<table class="blog-table">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Period</th><th>Best Area</th><th>Key Experience</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Dec-Mar</td><td>Ndutu / Southern Serengeti</td><td>Calving season, predator action</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Apr-May</td><td>Central Serengeti (Seronera)</td><td>Moving herds, green season value</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Jun-Jul</td><td>Western Corridor (Grumeti)</td><td>Grumeti River crossings</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Aug-Oct</td><td>Northern Serengeti (Kogatende)</td><td>Mara River crossings</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Nov</td><td>Eastern / Central Serengeti</td><td>Return migration south</td></tr>
  </tbody>

<p>Mobile camps that follow the migration are an excellent choice for serious migration enthusiasts, as they reposition throughout the year to stay near the action.</p>
