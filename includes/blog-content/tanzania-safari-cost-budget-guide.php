<p>One of the most common questions we receive from travelers planning their first African safari is: "How much does a Tanzania safari cost?" The answer varies dramatically depending on your accommodation preferences, group size, season, and itinerary. This transparent pricing guide breaks down every expense so you can plan a Tanzania safari that fits your budget without sacrificing quality.</p>

<h2>Understanding Tanzania Safari Pricing</h2>
<p>Tanzania safari costs are typically quoted on a per-person, per-day basis and include accommodation, meals, transport, park fees, and a professional guide. The total cost of your safari depends on four main factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Accommodation type:</strong> Camping, mid-range lodges, or luxury tented camps</li>
  <li><strong>Season:</strong> Peak season (June-October) costs 20-40% more than green season</li>
  <li><strong>Group size:</strong> Larger groups share vehicle and guide costs, reducing per-person rates</li>
  <li><strong>Duration and parks visited:</strong> More parks and longer trips increase costs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Budget Safari: $180-350 Per Person Per Day</h2>
<p>Budget safaris in Tanzania are far from "roughing it." You will stay in comfortable tented camps or basic lodges, share a safari vehicle with other travelers (up to 6 people), and still visit the same world-class parks as luxury travelers.</p>
<p><strong>What is included:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Shared 4x4 safari vehicle with pop-up roof</li>
  <li>English-speaking driver-guide</li>
  <li>Full board meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner)</li>
  <li>Park entrance and conservation fees</li>
  <li>Accommodation in budget lodges or permanent tented camps</li>
  <li>Airport transfers from Arusha or Kilimanjaro Airport</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Typical budget itinerary (5 days):</strong> Tarangire, Serengeti, and Ngorongoro Crater starting from approximately $1,400-1,750 per person based on group size. Our <a href="feb-march-2026-safari.php">February & March 2026 package</a> starts at just $1,476 per person for 6 people.</p>

<h2>Mid-Range Safari: $400-800 Per Person Per Day</h2>
<p>Mid-range safaris hit the sweet spot for most travelers. Accommodation upgrades to well-appointed lodges with swimming pools, en-suite bathrooms, and often stunning locations overlooking the bush or crater rim.</p>
<p><strong>Key upgrades from budget:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Private safari vehicle for your group</li>
  <li>Higher-quality lodges with en-suite facilities</li>
  <li>Better locations closer to prime wildlife areas</li>
  <li>More flexible game drive schedules</li>
  <li>Welcome drinks, afternoon tea, and higher meal quality</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical 6-day mid-range safari covering the Northern Circuit (Tarangire, Serengeti, Ngorongoro) costs $2,300-2,940 per person depending on group size and season.</p>

<h2>Luxury Safari: $600-1,500+ Per Person Per Day</h2>
<p>Luxury safaris represent the pinnacle of the Tanzania safari experience. Stay in award-winning lodges and intimate tented camps with gourmet dining, private guides, and exclusive wilderness locations far from the crowds.</p>
<p><strong>Luxury inclusions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Private 4x4 vehicle with dedicated expert guide</li>
  <li>Premium lodges or luxury mobile/tented camps</li>
  <li>Gourmet meals with premium wines and spirits</li>
  <li>Bush breakfasts, sundowner cocktails, and surprise bush dining</li>
  <li>Walking safaris, night game drives (where permitted)</li>
  <li>Domestic flights between parks (saving travel time)</li>
  <li>Laundry service and all gratuities</li>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Travel in the green season</strong> (April-May, November) for 30-40% lower rates with surprisingly good wildlife viewing</li>
  <li><strong>Increase your group size</strong> — safari costs per person drop significantly when sharing a vehicle with 4-6 people</li>
  <li><strong>Book early</strong> — the best lodges and camps offer early-bird discounts 6-12 months in advance</li>
  <li><strong>Mix accommodation levels</strong> — stay at a luxury lodge for your Ngorongoro night and budget camps for the Serengeti</li>
  <li><strong>Choose a local operator</strong> — booking directly with a Tanzania-based operator like <a href="about.php">iTanzania Safaris</a> eliminates middleman commissions</li>
