<p>The Serengeti National Park is synonymous with the African safari experience. Spanning 14,750 square kilometers of grassland, woodland, and riverine forest, it is home to the largest terrestrial mammal migration on Earth and one of the highest concentrations of predators in Africa. This guide covers everything you need to plan an unforgettable Serengeti safari.</p>

<h2>Why the Serengeti is Africa's Most Famous Safari Destination</h2>
<p>Named after the Maasai word "siringet" meaning "endless plains," the Serengeti delivers a wildlife experience unmatched anywhere on Earth. UNESCO designated it a World Heritage Site in 1981, recognizing its outstanding universal value for biodiversity.</p>
<p>The numbers speak for themselves: over 1.5 million wildebeest, 400,000 zebra, 3,000 lions, 1,000 leopards, and 500 cheetahs call this ecosystem home. Add 500+ bird species and you have arguably the greatest wildlife arena on the planet.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Serengeti's Regions</h2>
<p>The Serengeti is not one homogeneous landscape. It is divided into distinct regions, each offering different experiences depending on the season:</p>

<h3>Central Serengeti (Seronera)</h3>
<p>The heart of the park and the most visited area. The Seronera Valley has permanent water, making it a year-round wildlife hotspot. Expect excellent predator sightings — this area has one of the highest densities of leopards in Africa. The famous Serengeti kopjes (rocky outcrops) dot the landscape, often harboring lions.</p>

<h3>Southern Serengeti &amp; Ndutu</h3>
<p>Short-grass plains stretching to the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. This is calving season headquarters (December-March) when hundreds of thousands of wildebeest give birth. The open terrain makes for phenomenal predator-prey interactions and photography opportunities.</p>

<h3>Western Corridor (Grumeti)</h3>
<p>A wedge of land extending toward Lake Victoria. The migration passes through here from May to July, crossing the Grumeti River in dramatic fashion. This area is less visited than the north, offering a more exclusive experience. Large Nile crocodiles await the herds at river crossings.</p>

<h3>Northern Serengeti (Kogatende)</h3>
<p>The most remote and arguably most spectacular region. The famous Mara River crossings happen here from July to October, with tens of thousands of wildebeest plunging into crocodile-infested waters. Access is more difficult, keeping crowds lower despite the incredible action.</p>

<h2>The Great Migration: A Year-Round Spectacle</h2>
<p>The Great Migration is not a single event — it is a continuous, clockwise movement driven by rainfall and grass growth. The herds are always somewhere in the Serengeti ecosystem, and knowing where to be is the key to witnessing this spectacle.</p>
<p>The most dramatic moments are the river crossings at the Grumeti (June-July) and Mara (August-October) rivers, where crocodiles and the sheer chaos of millions of hooves create nature's ultimate drama. But the calving season (February) in the south offers equally compelling viewing as predators feast on the vulnerable newborns.</p>

<h2>Wildlife Beyond the Migration</h2>
<p>Even without the migration herds, the Serengeti's resident wildlife is extraordinary:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lions:</strong> The Serengeti has the largest lion population in Africa (~3,000). The pride dynamics around the Seronera kopjes are world-famous.</li>
  <li><strong>Leopards:</strong> The Seronera Valley offers some of the best leopard sightings on the continent. Look for them draped over sausage tree branches.</li>
  <li><strong>Cheetahs:</strong> The open southern plains are prime cheetah territory, particularly during calving season when prey is abundant.</li>
  <li><strong>Elephants:</strong> Large herds frequent the northern and western regions, particularly near rivers.</li>
  <li><strong>Hippos:</strong> The Retima Hippo Pool in central Serengeti has one of the largest hippo congregations in East Africa.</li>
  <li><strong>Birds:</strong> Over 500 species, from massive ostriches to tiny sunbirds. November to April brings migratory species from Europe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safari Activities in the Serengeti</h2>
<p><strong>Game Drives:</strong> The classic Serengeti experience. Morning and afternoon drives in open-roof 4x4 vehicles with your expert guide. Early morning drives offer the best predator activity and golden light for photography.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Air Balloon Safaris:</strong> Float over the endless plains at sunrise for a perspective no game drive can match. Available year-round from multiple launch sites. Cost is approximately $550-600 per person, including a champagne bush breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>Walking Safaris:</strong> Guided walks with armed rangers offer an intimate, ground-level perspective on the bush. Available in specific concession areas.</p>
<p><strong>Night Game Drives:</strong> Some private concessions allow after-dark drives, revealing nocturnal species like aardvarks, bush babies, and hunting hyenas.</p>

<h2>Best Time to Visit the Serengeti</h2>
<p>The Serengeti is a year-round destination, but the optimal time depends on what you want to see:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>River crossings:</strong> July to October (Northern Serengeti)</li>
  <li><strong>Calving season:</strong> January to March (Southern Serengeti/Ndutu)</li>
  <li><strong>Fewest crowds:</strong> April to May and November</li>
  <li><strong>Best overall weather:</strong> June to October (dry season)</li>
