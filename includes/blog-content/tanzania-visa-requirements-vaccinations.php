<p>Planning a Tanzania safari involves more than choosing parks and lodges. Understanding entry requirements, visa procedures, and health preparations is essential for a smooth trip. This guide covers everything from visa applications to vaccinations, malaria prevention, and travel insurance so you can arrive in Tanzania fully prepared.</p>

<h2>Tanzania Visa Requirements</h2>
<p>Most international visitors require a visa to enter Tanzania. The good news is the process is straightforward and can be completed online or on arrival.</p>

<h3>E-Visa (Recommended)</h3>
<p>Tanzania's electronic visa system allows you to apply online before traveling. This is the most efficient option:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Application website:</strong> visa.immigration.go.tz</li>
  <li><strong>Processing time:</strong> 3-10 business days (apply at least 2 weeks before travel)</li>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> $50 USD (single entry, 90 days) or $100 USD (multiple entry)</li>
  <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Passport scan, passport photo, return flight details, accommodation proof</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visa on Arrival</h3>
<p>Visas are available at Kilimanjaro International Airport (JRO), Julius Nyerere Airport (DAR), and major land borders:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> $50 USD (single entry) — US citizens pay $100 USD</li>
  <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Cash USD only (crisp, undamaged bills dated 2006 or later)</li>
  <li><strong>Wait time:</strong> 30-60 minutes depending on queue</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend the e-visa to avoid potential queues and to ensure your visa is confirmed before you board your flight.</p>

<h3>Passport Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Valid for at least 6 months beyond your date of entry</li>
  <li>At least 2 blank pages for stamps</li>
  <li>Good condition (no significant damage or water damage)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Yellow Fever Vaccination</h2>
<p>Tanzania requires proof of yellow fever vaccination if you are arriving from or have transited through a yellow fever endemic country. This includes many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South America.</p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If flying directly from Europe, North America, Asia, or the Middle East, yellow fever vaccination is <strong>not mandatory</strong> but is recommended</li>
  <li>If transiting through Ethiopia, Kenya, or another endemic country, you <strong>must</strong> have a valid yellow fever certificate</li>
  <li>The vaccination must be administered at least 10 days before arrival</li>
  <li>The International Certificate of Vaccination (yellow card) is valid for life</li>
  <li>Zanzibar has its own entry requirements and typically checks yellow fever certificates even for travelers arriving from mainland Tanzania</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommended Vaccinations for Safari Travelers</h2>
<p>Consult your travel health doctor at least 4-6 weeks before departure. The following vaccinations are commonly recommended for Tanzania:</p>
<table class="blog-table">

<h2>Malaria Prevention</h2>
<p>Malaria is present throughout Tanzania, including safari destinations and Zanzibar. Prevention is essential:</p>
<p><strong>Antimalarial medication options:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Malarone (Atovaquone/Proguanil):</strong> Most popular choice. Start 1-2 days before, continue 7 days after. Minimal side effects.</li>
  <li><strong>Doxycycline:</strong> Affordable alternative. Start 1-2 days before, continue 28 days after. Can cause sun sensitivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Mefloquine (Lariam):</strong> Weekly dosing but potential neuropsychiatric side effects. Discuss with your doctor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional malaria prevention measures:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Apply DEET-based insect repellent (30%+) to exposed skin, especially at dusk and dawn</li>
  <li>Wear long sleeves and trousers in the evenings</li>
  <li>Sleep under a mosquito net (provided at virtually all safari camps and lodges)</li>
  <li>Use mosquito coils or plug-in repellents in your room</li>
</ul>

<h2>Travel Insurance</h2>
<p>Comprehensive travel insurance is not legally required for Tanzania but is strongly recommended. A quality policy should include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Medical evacuation coverage</strong> — Critical for safari areas far from hospitals. Helicopter evacuation from the Serengeti to Nairobi can cost $10,000+.</li>
  <li><strong>Emergency medical treatment</strong> — Coverage of at least $100,000 for hospitalization</li>
  <li><strong>Trip cancellation/interruption</strong> — Protects your investment if plans change</li>
  <li><strong>Baggage loss/delay</strong> — Domestic flights in small planes can occasionally misroute luggage</li>
  <li><strong>High altitude coverage</strong> — If <a href="blog-post.php?slug=mount-kilimanjaro-climbing-guide">climbing Kilimanjaro</a>, ensure your policy covers altitude up to 6,000m</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Health Tips for Tanzania</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Water:</strong> Drink only bottled or purified water. Your safari operator will provide safe drinking water.</li>
  <li><strong>Food:</strong> Eat at your lodge or camp where food preparation standards are maintained. Avoid street food unless you have a strong stomach.</li>
  <li><strong>Sun protection:</strong> The equatorial sun is intense, especially at altitude. SPF 50+ sunscreen, hat, and sunglasses are essential.</li>
  <li><strong>Altitude:</strong> The Ngorongoro Crater rim sits at 2,235m and Kilimanjaro reaches 5,895m. Allow time to acclimatize if coming from sea level.</li>
</ul>
