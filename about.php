        <p style="color:rgba(51,51,51,0.7);line-height:1.75;margin-bottom:1rem;">iTanzania Safaris was founded with a simple mission: to provide authentic, high-quality Tanzanian experiences that benefit both travelers and local communities.</p>
        <p style="color:rgba(51,51,51,0.7);line-height:1.75;margin-bottom:1rem;">Based in Arusha, the safari capital of East Africa, we are a team of passionate locals who know every trail, every watering hole, and every secret viewpoint. We are not a booking agency — we are your on-the-ground partner.</p>
        <p style="color:rgba(51,51,51,0.7);line-height:1.75;">Every safari, every Kilimanjaro climb, and every Zanzibar escape is personally overseen by our team to ensure it meets our exacting standards.</p>
